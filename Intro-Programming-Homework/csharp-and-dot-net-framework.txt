Problem 13. C# and .NET Differences

.NET is an application development framework - it contains numerous libraries containing a range of functionality.
C# is a strong Object Oriented programming language that is mostly built on the .NET framework
.NET isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.
The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET (because the C# object model corresponds to the 
.NET object model and you can do anything interesting in C# just by using .NET libraries). 
The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other languages to write .NET applications.
